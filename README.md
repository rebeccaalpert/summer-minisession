# summer-minisession
Responsive landing page for Tufts Summer MiniSession, a new program from the Tufts University Office of Alumni Relations.

The website was developed for Tufts Marketing, based on a print brochure designed by Justin Clapp. I adapted it for the web, starting with paper wireframes. I later moved on to increasingly higher fidelity wireframes as I reviewed it with my colleagues, and I developed it myself.

I built it with the Bootstrap 3 front-end framework. I used CSS3 for the hero animation and JQuery for the buttons in the course section (they fade out when you click them and additional content fades in).
