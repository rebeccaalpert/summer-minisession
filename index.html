Every day, we're bombarded with messages about what, when, where, and how we should eat.

    	          <p>Perhaps even more important, by the end of our four days together, you'll have acquired the critical framework you need to size up future controversies as they arise, separate fact from hype, and make informed decisions about your nutrition.</p>

    	          <p>Based on our discussions of historic structures, engineering innovations, scientific discoveries, and cultural history, we'll develop ideas about the present relationships between engineering, science, and architecture and their place in contemporary American society.</p>
    	          <p>We'll look at all these issues in the context of three turning points that gave rise to our modern world&mdash;the Scientific Revolution, the Democratic Revolutions, and the Industrial Revolution.</p>
    	          <p>You may never look at an I-beam, bridge abutment, or load-bearing wall the same way again. You'll definitely gain deep insights into the essential ideas that, in a quite literal sense, have given structure to the world in which we live.</p>
